Modeling peptide-MHCII complexes

to generate and score peptide-MHCII complexes for the sequence in seq.fasta, run:

../../scripts/iterate_model_pMHC_SOAP.pl seq.fasta ../../libs/MHCII_models/DRB1_0101/model.pdb


There are two output files for two scoring functions: (i) seq.fasta.soap and (ii) seq.fasta.soap_pep
The first scoring function is MHCII specific, while the second is general for protein-peptide interactions.
If the input sequence is long (at least tens of peptides) than Zscore column should be informative, the lower the score the better.
Otherwise it is better to look at the second score column.
